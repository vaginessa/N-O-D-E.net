                NODE UPDATES - AUG 2017<br>
                --
                </div>

                <div id="post">
                <p>Hey everyone, I just wanted to make a quick update video to let you know what's going on with NODE, and what I have planned in the future. If you're not interested in that sort of thing, you can skip this video.</p>

                <p>Firstly, I just want to say thank you for watching the videos, I really do appreciate all of you who watch, comment, and support the channel.</p>

                <p>I've been thinking about the direction I would like to take NODE, and I realize that I really want to make more of a positive difference in the world.</p>

                <p>I do enjoy making hardware modding and raspberry pi projects, and I'll keep doing things like that, but I am also planning on adding a somw new series where I can focus my efforts, and hopefully bring you along with me.</p>

                <p>Here's what I have been thinking:</p>

                <div class="videowrapper">

                <p class="subtitle">DECENTRALIZE</p>

                <p>We live in a chaotic time, especially regarding technology, and sometimes our future can look a little dark. One shining light, however, is decentralized technology, and it's potential for giving control back to the users, whether that's in terms of issues like privacy, freedom of speech, open source code, data ownership etc.</p>

                <p>I've kind of been doing this already, I mean the channel is called NODE for a reason, but I want to focus more on this with a series called decentralize, where I'll go over various new and innovative software and hardware projects which could potentially improve things for us.</p>

                <p>If you know of any great decentralized projects out there that you think I should cover, let me know.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">DIY SCIENCE</p>

                <p>Another series I am starting is around DIY and Open Source science. The idea is to show people how to create certain hardware, which at the moment is either expensive or generally difficult for the regular citizen to get ahold of and use. From general scientific tools, to medical equipment, agricultural technology, or even space related projects, I want to explore how we can get this knowledge to as wide an audience as possible.</p>

                <p>I want to shift the idea of science being something for governments and wealthy companies, back to the citizens, and underground scientists.</p>

                <p>For example, one goal I'd love to achieve would be to see if you could make an open source DNA analyzer.</p>

                <p>I know there are quite a few of you who watch these videos who are very capable, and are familiar with these different fields, so if you know of any interesting open source projects you or others are doing, I want to help promote them, or if you'd like to collab on a project for this and make something together, get in touch.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">LIVESTREAMS</p>

                <p>I still am planning on starting some sort of livestream, but still need to figure out the format and the setup I'd need to achieve it. So stay tuned for that.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">DEAD DROP</p>

                <p>I also wanted to let you know that I will be continuing the Dead Drop series shortly too. I must admit it is a little daunting doing those videos because there is just an overwhelming amount of things happening all the time, but it will be returning.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

                <p>So those are my plans. Like I said earlier, I'll still be making the kind of videos I do now, but the new stuff will be joining it. I'm not going to make a concrete schedule for it, so for now I'll just be doing it when I can.</p>

                <p>If you have any ideas or projects you'd like to share related to what I've said, leave them in the comments or email them to me.</p>

                <p>mail@n-o-d-e.net</p>

                <p>Remember that we are all nodes in the network. As always, I appreciate you watching this, and I'll see you in the next video.</p>
