                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 45, your look at what's happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. As always, all source links mentioned are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>Here's a sign of things to come. Esri, a geographic data company, have teamed up with a  water utility in New Jersey to create an interactive augmented reality map of the underground water and sewage systems. It uses a Microsoft Hololens, and the aim is to aid workers in visualizing these systems as they do their jobs.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86UQ0i5MPOA</p>

                <p>The Verge also uploaded a new in depth video talking about the Avegant AR headset. What makes this one different from most headsets is its layered light field display, which gives users the ability to naturally focus their eyes on virtual objects.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKlkezPV3vM</p>

                <p>DHL have been doing more interesting things too, this time developing an augmented reality system for package pickers to increase their efficiency. The AR glasses automatically scan items that are held up, and tell the workers where to place them in real time.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMwgXcPVAR8</p>


                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>Related to logistics, more and more companies are starting to use robots within their warehouses or factories to improve efficiency, including the Relay, which is basically a little robo messenger which delivers items between workers and departments.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMz1luRHzUg</p>

                <p>I've shown quite a few exosuits in this series, but none like this. ReWalk showed off theirs recently, which is fairly unique in that it is both soft and looks very flexible, all while still enabling the user to carry 15-20% more weight.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SyEdG1haQ00</p>


                <p class="subtitle">3D PRINTING</p>

                <p>Researchers from Bath and Cambridge Universities have created a 3D printed prototype for an open source microscope which only costs $40. It can magnify up to 1.5 millionth of a meter, which is enough to identify parasites such as malaria in blood or water samples.</p>

                <p>http://www.3ders.org/articles/20170803-uk-research-team-3d-prints-open-source-microscope-prototype-for-only-30.html</p>

                <p>In other news, the US Navy have 3d printed the hull of a small submarine for the first time in it's history. Apparently submarine hulls usually take months to build ordinarily, whereas this was completed in a few weeks.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DIY</p>

                <p>Here's something I didn't know you could do with a Pi Zero. Youtube user Hugatry's HackVlog made a video showing you how to add a second micro SD card slot to the device for storage, while still having the USB port free. I may have to take advantage of this.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMLaNqOBdvk</p>


                <p class="subtitle">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>

                <p>One of the aspects of virtual reality I'm looking forward to seeing are user interfaces, and two projects have been working on this, specicially for design software.</p>

                <p>Make VR introduced their VR-based CAD system which lets users create 3D models for CAM and 3D printing.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH7ETRbNaHI</p>

                <p>Another app showed off the trailer for its VR graphic design system, called Singularity. This one definitely looks more experimental, but I am looking forward to seeing how design will evolve when it's aimed at immersive 3D space.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">THIS WEEK ON NODE</p>

                <p>I uploaded a new video this week showing you how to turn the Pi Zero into a HDMI dongle, allowing you to plug directly into a TV or monitor.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AMKZVfbPvMY</p>

                <p>I also made an update video talking about some of the changes I had in mind for the channel. Check that out if you're interested in the direction NODE will be taking soon.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KB4_z-lR91U</p>

                <p>I'm working on revamping the shop, and adding a variety new products soon, so keep an eye out for that. As always, I appreciate you watching the videos, and I'll see you in the next one.</p>
