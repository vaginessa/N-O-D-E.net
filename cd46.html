                <p>Welcome to Cyber Dump number 46, your look at what's happening in this insane age of technology that we live in. As always, all source links mentioned are below.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">DIY</p>

                <p>Florian Wesch uploaded a really cool video showing you how to create a video wall using multiple raspberry pi's and monitors. You simply take a picture of the display configuration and the info beamer app automatically calculates the distances, allowing you to stream a single video on the setup.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GI00HTJhSMU</p>


                <p class="subtitle">VIRTUAL REALITY</p>

                <p>Following on from previous mentions of businesses using augmented reality, postal company UPS has now also begun testing the use of virtual reality when training delivery drivers.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fypGVcmWpnU</p>


                <p class="subtitle">AUGMENTED REALITY</p>

                <p>Surgeons are starting to use AR as a training tool aswell, this time enabling surgeons in other parts of the world to guide colleagues in real time. Imagine what this'll be like when headsets, and spacial tracking is involved.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuPS1nj2mtE</p>

                <p>I keep seeing interesting Apple ARKit demos, and this new one by Zach Lieberman is also cool. I can't wait to see what Apple's hardware is like for this platform.</p>

                <p>https://twitter.com/zachlieberman/status/897945041573879808</p>


                <p class="subtitle">BITCOIN</p>

                <p>This week Blockstream unveiled their satellite network, which broadcasts the bitcoin blockchain from space. According to them, anyone with a small satellite dish and USB receiver can receive the blocks.</p>

                <p>https://blockstream.com/2017/08/15/announcing-blockstream-satellite.html<br>

                <p class="subtitle">DRONES</p>

                <p>Raytheon recently showed off the results from a test they conducted earlier in April this year. They modified a stinger missile so that it can track and destroy drones, either by direct hit, or using a new proximity fuse.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">3D PRINTING</p>

                <p>Now these are two great examples of the power of 3D printing. Engineer Julio Vazquez has created two modified Nintendo Switch controllers, which allow one handed players to play on the console. He originally designed these for his friend who lost a hand, but has also uploaded the files for anyone to use.</p>

                https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2443517</p>

                <p>Another project helped give Frankie the toucan a new beak, after his was seriously damaged during a storm. Pretty cool</p>

                <p class="subtitle">ROBOTICS</p>

                <p>I've talked a lot about Exoskeletons recently, and here's a new, slightly different take on it. Bionik Labs' ARKE exoskeleton has Amazon Echo integration, meaning paralysed users can also control the suit by using voice commands.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GaKYSBID_E</p>

                <p>Researchers at Harvard have also been experimenting with a low cost fish robot design, which can successfully navigate in any direction in water using magnet-in-coil actuators. Aside from the low cost, this design also means you can create very small water robots that require minimal sealing.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">VIDEOS</p>

                <p>Two new videos this week. The first is a quick overview of the HyperLoop One transport system and how it works using electromagnets.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAWEOwDDt_Y&t=4s</p>

                <p>The next video by OpenAI shows their new Artificial Intelligence system playing a 1v1 game of Dota 2 against a world class human oponent. I won't spoil the outcome, but you can guess what happens.</p>

                <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiOopO9jTZw</p>

                <p>Alright, that's it for this week. Thanks for watching, and see you in the next video.</p>
