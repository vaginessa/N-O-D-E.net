                OPENDIME V2: CYBERPUNK CREDSTICKS RETURN (+ GIVEAWAY)<br>

                <div id="post">
                <p>The OpenDime (OpenDime.com) is one of those projects which really captures the imagination. Like I mentioned in the previous video, there's something distinctly cyberpunk about these devices, and when I heard there was a new version of it, I had to take a look.</p>

                <p>I have a few of these to giveaway too, so check the end of the video for more details.</p>

                <p>Thanks again to Rodolfo from Coinkite for sending these over to show you.</p>

                <p class="subtitle">UPDATED DESIGN</p>

                <p>The first thing you notice, is the new updated design is smaller than the previous version, measuring in at 40x12mm.</p>

                <p>This one now has rounded edges, which makes it much more comfortable when in your hand or pocket.</p>

                <p>There's also a hole at the top, so you can attach it to a keychain, or carry it around your neck.</p>

                <p>The unlocking mechanism is different and more robust on this next version, but I'll get more into that later.</p>

                <p>There is also now a dedicated anti-counterfeiting chip on the board, which holds a secret key assigned by the OpenDime factory, making it easier to verify you have a genuine stick.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">HOW TO USE</p>

                <p>Setup is much the same as last time, and involves plugging the OpenDime into a computer, phone or tablet, then dragging some files onto the drive which creates randomness to generate your unique Bitcoin private key and address.</p>

                <p>Again, this is all done on the processors of the OpenDime itself, and this process doesn't touch the computer.</p>

                <p>You then open the index.htm file on the drive, and you'll see your bitcoin address and QR code, which you can send funds to.</p>

                <p>This time, when you want to unlock the funds and spend them, you need to get a pin or pointy tool, and push it through the hole on the back of the stick.</p>

                <p>This pops out what looks like a resistor on the other side, altering the circuitry, and permanently changing the flash memory in the processor.</p>

                <p>The private keys are then available on the drive, and can be imported into any bitcoin wallet to spend the funds.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">USE CASES</p>

                <p>I think the OpenDime's strongest selling points are that they're a way to securely gift someone Bitcoin, or perhaps to use as a type of paper wallet replacement for yourself.</p>

                <p>They'd be perfect for buying mid to large value items in a secure, off-line way, which leaves no trace on Bitcoin's blockchain.</p>

                <p>There are still some challenges to overcome regarding fluctuating exchange rates, trust, and security when using these as an everyday replacement to cash, especially when transactions involve strangers.</p>


                <p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

                <p>Hats off to Coinkite. This is a solid iteration on the previous design, and a lot of the little changes make it so much better to use and carry.</p>

                <p>Like I mentioned earlier, I think these are especially great for transactions with trusted parties.</p>

                <p>For transactions with strangers, maybe there needs to be some kind of simple hardware device a user could use in order to validate the factory assigned secret key, quickly proving it's a real OpenDime, and also automatically showing the balance and address associated with the stick.</p>

                <p>It'd also be cool if they made a stealth version which looked like a blank flash drive specifically to be used as a paper wallet. </p>


                <p class="subtitle">GIVEAWAY</p>

                <p>I have a bunch of Version 1 and 2 Open Dimes to give away, so if you'd like to get your hands on them, make sure you're subscribed and leave a comment in this video.</p>

                <p>I'll pick a few winners at random in about a week, and will ship them anywhere in the world. As always, thanks for watching.</p>
